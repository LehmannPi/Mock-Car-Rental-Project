# Mock Car Rental Project

## About
This project is a car rental management application (in Portuguese "locadora de carros") with database integration, made for the Event-Driven Programming subject at IFMG, Brasil.

It was made in Portuguese, using Lazarus IDE, with Pascal programming language, and PostgreSQL 12 to set the database.

The earlier version is simpler, with only one query screen besides the registration screens, using a local database (locadora.db) made with SQLite3.

The mock data for the project was made with [Mockaroo](https://www.mockaroo.com/) and the logo was made with [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/).

The application allows registration of vehicles, clients, rents and payments, queries with multiple conditions and generation of 3 types of report:
  * Clients;
  * Vehicle by Client; and
  * Payment by Client.
